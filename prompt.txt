Figma Make Prompt — Section 1 (Hero)
Create the hero section for a modern portfolio website with a clean, cool, minimalist vibe and generous negative space. The layout should feel premium, legible, and confident. Use placeholder text but label all fields clearly as “Name”, “Title”, and “About me”. Include a Download CV button and a Get in touch button that visually indicates it scrolls to the footer.

Hero Content & Layout Requirements
- Left column:
  - Large headline: Name
  - Subheadline: Title
  - Short paragraph labeled: About me with lorem ipsum
  - Two buttons:
    - Primary: Download CV
    - Secondary: Get in touch (with subtle arrow or anchor icon to hint scroll)
- Right column:
  - A portrait placeholder inside a clean, slightly stylized frame (circle or rounded rectangle)
  - A small favicon placeholder (square 48x48) positioned subtly near the portrait (top-right or top-left), as a branding accent
  - The favicon should be a minimal monogram using initials “M.H”

Style Direction
- Mood: Clean, cool, modern, minimal, with subtle wow factor
- Typography: Use a bold, expressive headline font paired with a clean readable body font (not default system fonts)
- Color palette: Mostly neutral (white / off-white / light gray), with one restrained accent color for buttons and subtle highlights
- Spacing: Large margins and padding; clear visual breathing room
- Grid: 12-column layout; hero spans full width with content centered in a max-width container

Motion / Interaction Notes (for Figma prototyping cues)
- Add notes for smooth, precise motion:
  - Hero content fades in with staggered animation
  - Portrait softly reveals with a mask or subtle scale-in
  - Buttons have a gentle hover lift (no aggressive bounce)

Additional Notes
- Keep everything sleek and minimal, but add one distinctive visual detail (e.g., thin accent line, subtle gradient band, or a small geometric shape near the portrait) to deliver a wow moment without clutter.

Responsiveness
- Ensure the layout scales cleanly for phone, tablet, and large monitors. Design with a mobile-first mindset and provide desktop and mobile variants where appropriate.

Figma Make Prompt — Section 2 (Skills Gallery: Stars + Planets Constellation)
Create a skills gallery section that visualizes skills as a starfield/planet system. The theme is dark overall (black/dark charcoal background) with white text and minimal, cool accents. The design should stay clean and legible with generous negative space.

Concept
- Use a starfield motif: small dots for minor skills, larger “planets” for core domains.
- No literal planet artwork needed; keep it abstract: circles, dots, thin orbit lines.
- Visual style: white on black, with one subtle accent color for highlights.

Layout Requirements
- Section title: “Skills” (placeholder ok)
- Subtext: short lorem ipsum line explaining breadth of skills
- Central constellation/planet system that fills the width of the section
- Each large planet represents a skill domain (label beneath or near the planet)
- Each planet has 3–6 smaller “moons” (skill chips) orbiting or clustered nearby

Motion / Interaction Notes (for prototyping cues)
- Slow, smooth orbital drift (subtle)
- On hover: planet softly glows and its moons fade in or expand
- Keep motion precise and minimal—no bouncy effects

Accessibility & Legibility
- Maintain high contrast (white text on dark background)
- Labels must be readable at a glance

Responsiveness
- Ensure the constellation rearranges cleanly for mobile and tablet (stacked or simplified clusters)

Figma Make Prompt — Section 3 (Projects: Focus Lock Showcase)
Create a projects section that highlights 4 heavy-hitting projects using a “Focus Lock” carousel animation. The section should feel premium and clean, with a subtle wow factor and strong legibility.

Concept
- A horizontal “Focus Lock” carousel that auto-cycles every 5–6 seconds.
- Show 3 cards at a time: center card is active, left/right are partial previews.
- When the center card locks in, it expands to near full width with a soft dim/blur of the background rail.
- The active panel expands smoothly with a gentle zoom and soft reveal of details.

Layout Requirements
- Section title: “Projects” (placeholder ok)
- Short subtext line (lorem ipsum)
- Exactly 4 project cards total: each shows project name, role, tech stack chips, and 1–2 sentence summary
- Active project expands to near full width with visible sections:
  - Project Name
  - Role
  - Tech Stack chips
  - Key Highlights (3 bullets)
  - CTA buttons: “View Project” and “Case Study” (placeholder)

Motion / Interaction Notes (for prototyping cues)
- Auto-cycle with smooth easing, 5–6s interval
- On hover/tap: pause cycle and expand details
- Use sliding + fade + scale for transitions, no bounce

Style Direction
- Match clean/minimal aesthetic with generous spacing
- Use subtle accent color for active project and CTA buttons
- Keep backgrounds minimal; use thin borders or soft shadow for depth

Responsiveness
- On mobile: convert carousel to vertical stack with one expanded card and swipe navigation

Figma Make Prompt — Section 4 (Certs, Accomplishments, CCA Collage)
Create a simple, clean collage section that showcases technical certificates, accomplishments, and CCA activities. The collage should be a grid of photo placeholders that cycles through images. Keep it minimal and secondary in visual hierarchy compared to Projects.

Layout Requirements
- Section title: “Certs & Accomplishments” (placeholder ok)
- Short subtext line (lorem ipsum)
- Collage grid: 6–10 photo placeholders (mixed sizes for visual interest)
- On hover/tap: image expands to show the full photo in a lightbox-style view

Motion / Interaction Notes
- Slow, subtle auto-cycle of images (crossfade)
- Expansion is smooth and clean, no bounce

Style Direction
- Minimal framing, thin borders or soft shadow
- Keep spacing generous and consistent with the rest of the page

Responsiveness
- On mobile: grid collapses to a single column with swipe to view

Figma Make Prompt — Section 5 (Testimonials)
Create a simple testimonials section with static text cards and circular photo bubbles. The tone should be professional and credible.

Layout Requirements
- Section title: “Testimonials” (placeholder ok)
- 2–4 testimonial cards
- Each card includes:
  - Quote text (lorem ipsum)
  - Name + role (e.g., Lecturer, Intern Supervisor)
  - LinkedIn profile link placeholder
  - Circular photo bubble

Style Direction
- Clean cards with soft borders or subtle shadows
- Keep spacing generous, legible typography

Responsiveness
- On mobile: stack cards vertically

Figma Make Prompt — Section 6 (Footer + Header Behavior)
Create a footer that is fixed to the bottom of the viewport and a header that is sticky on scroll.

Header Requirements
- Sticky header that follows the scroll
- Contains: Name | navigation links to each section | favicon (M.H)
- Minimal, clean styling with subtle separation from content (thin line or soft blur)

Footer Requirements
- Fixed to bottom of viewport (always visible)
- CTA text (e.g., “Let’s build something great.” placeholder)
- Icon row with hover expansion for: LinkedIn, GitHub, Gmail
- Icons enlarge slightly on hover with smooth easing

Style Direction
- Keep footer clean and unobtrusive, consistent with the overall aesthetic
- High contrast for icons and CTA text

Responsiveness
- On mobile: header nav collapses into compact layout; footer icons stack or reduce size
